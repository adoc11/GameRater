GameRater
=========

The goals of this project are to provide an easy way for people to keep track of the various games they play on different platforms as well as how they thought about those particular games.

To start the application you must have the latest version of Java installed on your computer.

Next simply open the GameRater.jar file and the application should be open and you should be presented with an empty table and the ability to add a game to it.

How to Use:

The game table is sortable and filterable. The table is sorted by latest date by default but by clicking on the headers of the table each column can be sorted in ascending and descending order. 

Typing a name of a game into the search field at the top of the table and hitting the Enter key or clicking "Search" will filter the table for only games that contain the search query.

========================================================================================================================

Adding a game:

If there are no games in the table, click the "Add" button near the bottom of the window. In the add game dialog window that appears type in the name of the game you wish to add. 

Then what platform the game is for. If the user wants to specify the same game for multiple platforms they need to re-add the game and just pick a different platform each time. 

Then the user can rate the game on a scale of 1 - 10 with 1 being the worst and 10 the best.

Next users can add a brief synopsis or opinion of the game.

Lastly, if the user wants to go into more detail about the game they can use the review editor to do their own review of the game as if they were a games journalist.  The editor supports html formatting.

========================================================================================================================

Editing the Game Table

The main game table is fully editable just incase a mistake was made when creating the game entry or if the user's opinion of the garme has changed.

By double clicking any of the table cells except date, which is updated automatically with the date the information was changed, a dialog window will appear allowing the user to change the field. Clicking save will update the table with the updated information.

If a platform for a game the user has played does not appear in the platforms dropdown a platform can be added to the dropdown by selecting "--Add a Platform--". Selecting this will open up a new dialogue allowing the user to type in the name of the platform they wish to add. This will update the platform change dialog window and select the new platform you added.

========================================================================================================================

Removing From the Table

Simply select 1 or more rows from the table and click on the "Remove" Button

========================================================================================================================

Viewing a game

If the user selects a row from the table and clicks on the "View" button a view dialog window will appear. This window will display all the information about that game in a less cluttered view than that of the game table. The review for the game is also viewable here.

The view window can also act as an edit window for games as every field has an edit button next to it. Clicking on the edit button will change the view field to an edit field.
